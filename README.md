Thrift is a web application for your closet, your wallet and your planet. 
It is a one-stop shop for renting, re-selling and thrifting. 
Our web app resells clothing and other personal items at a reasonable price. 
It helps you find a sustainable way to renovate your closet. 
The big difference between a thrift store and a retail store is that 
the items for sale at a thrift store aren’t new but that doesn’t mean 
they aren’t in a good condition. Thrift shopping is a way of giving those items a new life.
